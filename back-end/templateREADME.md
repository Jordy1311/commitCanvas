# Your commitCanvas Art Project!!

First and foremost, thank you for using the commitCanvas!!

This is the resulting repository made from your inputs on the commitCanvas

Sit back and take your beautiful art work displayed on your profile page!! If it isn't currently showing, give GitHub a few seconds and refresh. It's a hard job displaying a lot of simulated work!

## Deleting this project

I completely understand if you wish to delete this project. Often times life's seriousness gets in the way!!

#### To delete:

1.  Locate the **Settings** tab and navigate to it. *If you can't seem to locate, try the more options menu*.

2.  Once in the Settings tab, locate the **Options** section and scroll to the very bottom into the **"Danger Zone"**.

3.  Select **"Delete this repository"** and follow GitHubs prompts until you have successfully deleted the repository.

The commitCanvas art should soon vanish.

Thanks again and come again soon!!
